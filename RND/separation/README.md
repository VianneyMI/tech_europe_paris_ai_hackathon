# Separation R&D

This folder contains:
- `TOOLS_OVERVIEW.md`: matrix and tradeoffs across evaluated tools.
- `LEARNINGS.md`: general stem separation notes and troubleshooting.
- `demucs/`, `spleeter/`, `openunmix/`: three mini-apps with isolated UV projects.

Each mini-app accepts a local audio path and writes:
- `vocals.wav`
- `music.wav`
