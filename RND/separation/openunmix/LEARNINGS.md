# Open-Unmix learnings

- Open-Unmix naturally gives 4 stems, so a tiny post-step is needed to build one `music` track.
- The `umx` CLI is stable and easy to automate.
- Quality can be slightly behind newer Demucs models on difficult vocals, but setup is simpler than some TensorFlow stacks.
- Explicit mixing gives control over clipping and output level management.
