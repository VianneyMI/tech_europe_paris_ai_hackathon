# Objective

Turn isolated vocal audio into accurate written lyrics using Gradium speech-to-text.

## Assignment

Run a practical experiment with Gradium STT on separated vocals and deliver at least one clear, reproducible working example. Focus on lyric accuracy and readability.

## Outputs

- Produce **at least one working, standalone script** (single file) that accepts a local vocal-audio path and prints the transcription.
- Note any key settings used (model, decoding params, preprocessing) so results can be reproduced.
